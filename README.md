# My First Web Music Player

Welcome to my first web music player project. This project aims to create a simple web-based music player with commercially free music by known artists.

## Technologies Used

- **CSS3**: For styling the user interface and enhancing visual appeal.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing interactive features such as playing music, managing playlists, and controlling the player.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosted the project repository and deployed the web music player using GitHub Pages.
